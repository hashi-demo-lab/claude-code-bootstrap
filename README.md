## üîÑ Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token for authentication |
| `NODE_OPTIONS` | Node.js memory allocation (4GB by default) |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Location of Claude configuration |
| `CLAUDE_GITHUB_MCP_ENABLED` | Enables Claude GitHub integration |

## ÔøΩ Usage

The container automatically sets up the necessary environment for working with:

1. Claude Code in VS Code
2. GitHub CLI integration with Claude
3. Terraform projects with security scanning tools
4. Network-isolated development environment

## ÔøΩ MCP Servers

This devcontainer supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, including Docker-based MCP servers.

### Using Docker-based MCP Servers

The devcontainer is configured with:

- Docker CLI installed
- Docker socket mounted from the host
- Support for running Docker commands inside the container

A sample Terraform MCP server is included in the `.mcp.json` file at the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "terraform": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Custom MCP Servers

To add your own MCP servers:

1. Edit the `.mcp.json` file at the project root
2. Add your server configuration following the MCP protocol
3. Claude Code will automatically detect and prompt for approval

For more information, see the [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp).

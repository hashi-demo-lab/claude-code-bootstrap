# Phase 4: Implementation Planning

## Prompt Structure for Development Strategy

### Development Approach

**Module Development Order:**
- Which modules should be developed first based on dependencies?
- How can modules be developed and tested independently?
- What shared resources or data sources need to be created first?
- How will module integration be validated?

**Testing Strategy:**
- What unit tests are needed for individual modules?
- How will integration testing be performed?
- What test environments and fixtures are required?
- How will security and compliance testing be automated?

**Code Organization:**
- How should the repository structure be organized?
- What file naming conventions will be used?
- How will module versions and releases be managed?
- What documentation standards will be followed?

**Quality Assurance:**
- What linting and formatting tools will be used?
- How will security scanning be integrated?
- What peer review processes will be followed?
- How will code quality metrics be tracked?

### Implementation Checklist

   - [ ] Code quality tools configured

2. **Module Development**
   - [ ] Core resource definitions implemented
   - [ ] Variable validation and defaults configured  
   - [ ] Output definitions completed
   - [ ] Documentation generated

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] Unit tests passing
   - [ ] Integration tests completed
   - [ ] Security scans clean
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks met

4. **Documentation and Release**
   - [ ] README and usage examples complete

### Risk Management

**Technical Risks:**
- Provider API changes and deprecations
- Resource dependency conflicts
- State management complications
- Performance and scaling issues

**Operational Risks:**
- Deployment rollback scenarios
- Backup and recovery procedures
